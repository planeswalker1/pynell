    <h2>About Pynell</h2>
    <p>
      Founded in 2018, we are an independent and growing American web studio. We are committed to building the next generation of websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since we started our mission has been simple: to build generation-defining websites. To us, a generation-defining website consists of more than just a great website. They have a lasting impact on an entire sector of the population. They have a cultural impact, bring people together, create memories that will last a lifetime and push the entire medium of websites forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generation-defining websites are few and far between. We have shaped our entire organization in a manner that we think will allow us to create websites of that caliber. We do not follow trends or emulate what others have done. We have a flat and open corporate structure that promotes the sharing and exploration of new, innovative and creative ideas.
